At <https://webrtc-chat-example.gonzalocaparros.eu.org> this can be tested with a simple UI.

## JS Console

This example opens a bidirectional `RTCDataChannel` connection between two tabs
of the same browser without the need for a signalign server.

Copy peerA.js contents into a new tab's JavaScript console and peerB.js contents
into another tab's JavaScript console. Write `sendMessage('Hello!')` in one
console and see the message being received in the other console.
